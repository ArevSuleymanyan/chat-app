Create a chat application that will have a very simple web user interface.
When a user connects to the web UI he will first be asked to enter the desired nickname for the chat and clicking on connect will connect him to the chat.
The chat window will consist of a message panel where we display messages from the chat and an edit box with the "Send" button to send a new message to the chat.

Technical requirements.

- Should be written in Node.js;
- We should write the app in a way that it can be set to use multiple CPUs (we can use Nginx for load balancing and Redis for communication);
- There are a lot of examples online for similar apps, and it is okay to use them as learning material or samples, but would be good to implement this ourselves
